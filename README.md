# LetsBloom

Builded a simple RESTful API for managing a library system. This Project deals with the adding the details of the book, getting all the books, and updating the details of a book through its specific id.
I have specified a moongoose schema with the name, author and genre of the book. Also, to create and retrieve data and to access it, I have used Thunder-Client in Vs-code which works same as Postman.

Base url: http://localhost:7000/

1. To POST a book and its details.
   You need to use api http://localhost:7000/books and create a json object with the deatils of the book.
